# Diabetes_detection_using_custom_preceptrons-
In this project I characterized whether a person is diabetic or not the given dataset has various features that tells if a patient is diabetic or not to do this, I implemented a perceptron model for binary classification using a simple training function with a specified accuracy target. It uses 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance on different subsets of the dataset. The perceptron is trained iteratively, adjusting weights based on errors, until a specified number of iterations or until the model achieves perfect accuracy. Additionally, it includes a function to plot confusion matrices for each fold, providing insights into the model's performance.
